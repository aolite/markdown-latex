abstract: "A single paragraph of about 200 words maximum. For research articles, abstracts should give a pertinent overview of the work. We strongly encourage authors to use the following style of structured abstracts, but without headings: 1) Background: Place the question addressed in a broad context and highlight the purpose of the study; 2) Methods: Describe briefly the main methods or treatments applied; 3) Results: Summarize the article's main findings; and 4) Conclusion: Indicate the main conclusions or interpretations. The abstract should be an objective representation of the article: it must not contain results which are not presented and substantiated in the main text and should not exaggerate the main conclusions."
keywords: [keyword 1; keyword 2; keyword 3. List three to ten pertinent keywords specific to the article, yet reasonably common within the subject discipline.]

# How to Use this Template

The template details the sections that can be used in a manuscript. Sections that are not mandatory are listed as such. The section titles given are for Articles. Review papers and other article types have a more flexible structure. For any questions, please contact the editorial office of the journal or support@mdpi.com. For LaTeX related questions please contact Janine Daum at latex-support@mdpi.com.

# Introduction

The introduction should briefly place the study in a broad context and highlight why it is important. It should define the purpose of the work and its significance. The current state of the research field should be reviewed carefully and key publications should be cited. Please highlight controversial and diverging hypotheses when necessary. Finally, briefly mention the main aim of the work and highlight the main conclusions. As far as possible, please keep the introduction comprehensible to scientists outside your particular field of research. Citing a journal paper [@Meier-Kolthoff2013]. And now citing a book reference [@Meier-Kolthoff2013]

# Results

This section may be divided by subheadings. It should provide a concise and precise description of the experimental results, their interpretation as well as the experimental conclusions that can be drawn.

## Subsection

### Subsubsection

Bulleted lists look like this:

- First bullet
- Second bullet
- Third bullet

Numbered lists can be added as follows:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Figures, Tables and Schemes

All figures and tables should be cited in the main text as Figure 1, Table 1, etc.

![This is a figure, Schemes follow the same formatting. If there are multiple panels, they should be listed as: (\textbf{a}) Description of what is contained in the first panel. (\textbf{b}) Description of what is contained in the second panel. Figures should be placed in the main text near to the first time they are cited. A caption on a single line should be centered.](logo-mdpi.eps)

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{This is a table caption. Tables should be placed in the main text near to the first time they are cited.}
\small % Font size can be changed to match table content. Recommend 10 pt.
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Title 1}	& \textbf{Title 2}	& \textbf{Title 3}\\
\midrule
entry 1		& data			& data\\
entry 2		& data			& data\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

## Formatting of Mathematical Components

This is an example of an equation:

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{S}
\end{equation}

Please punctuate equations as regular text. Theorem-type environments (including propositions, lemmas, corollaries etc.) can be formatted as follows:

\begin{Theorem}
Example text of a theorem.
\end{Theorem}

The text continues here. Proofs must be formatted as follows:

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem 1]
Text of the proof. Note that the phrase `of Theorem 1' is optional if it is clear which theorem is being referred to.
\end{proof}
The text continues here.

# Discussion

This section may be divided by subheadings. Authors should discuss the results and how they can be interpreted in perspective of previous studies and of the working hypotheses. The findings and their implications should be discussed in the broadest context possible. Future research directions may also be highlighted.

# Materials and Methods

This section should be divided by subheadings. Materials and Methods should be described with sufficient details to allow others to replicate and build on published results. Please note that publication of your manuscript implicates that you must make all materials, data, and protocols associated with the publication available to readers. Please disclose at the submission stage any restrictions on the availability of materials or information. New methods and protocols should be described in detail while well-established methods can be briefly described and appropriately cited.

Research manuscripts reporting large datasets that are deposited in a publicly available database should specify where the data have been deposited and provide the relevant accession numbers. If the accession numbers have not yet been obtained at the time of submission, please state that they will be provided during review. They must be provided prior to publication.

# Conclusions

This section is not mandatory, but can be added to the manuscript if the discussion is unusually long or complex.
